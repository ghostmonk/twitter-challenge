## Twitter Challenge

A front-end with standards compliant, asynchronous, API driven, beauteous JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

##Part 1

Use the twitter API to create three columns containing the last 30 tweets from @AppDirect, @laughingsquid and @techcruch.

## Part 2

Create an edit layout that allows various UI changes.


## Twitter Proxy Server

Unfortunately you have to run the twitter proxy using a separate process.
The proxy should be started first... so that it is available to the console application.
In addition, the node modules should be installed separately from the main application.
Do the following commands in order

```cd twitter-proxy```
```npm install```
```npm start```
